# Description
CS245 Swing Project by Team HOLY. To design a hangman GUI application in Swing Java.

Members: Henry Hu, Y-Uyen La, Luis Cortes, Oscar Hernandez, and An Le.

# Rules

It is best if we do not make a mess of the repo. Before you push to the origin master branch, you should make your own branch and test your own code on that.

# Deadlines

1/18 - Project 1.0 due

1/25 - Project 1.1 due

2/6 - Project 1.2 due

# Some commands for our Reference

Git for Windows Desktop is a GUI that can be used instead of commands.

If you do use commands, you can get Git Shell for Windows or use terminal for Linux/MacOS.

"git init" : First time setup, do this in a directory meant for the project.

"git remote add origin https://github.com/henryh1570/Swing-Project.git" : First time to clone the origin branch to your machine.

"git status" : Shows you what files/directories are tracked for the project if there are any changes made.

"git pull" : If your files are behind in commits, you can update them from the latest branch. You might get merge conflicts so you must fix them doing this.

"git add" : Can add new or changed files/directories to be tracked for the project.

"git commit -m 'ENTER_YOUR_MESSAGE_HERE'" : Make a comment and commit it so that the changes made are ready to go.

"git push -u BRANCH_NAME_HERE" : Push the changes after committing so that the repo online gets updated.
